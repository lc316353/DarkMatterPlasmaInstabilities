Here is the PIC-code and the code to create animations from the results. In PIC.py, change the parameters below the function definitions to create the setup you are interested in. If write=True, it will save things to a file in the same folder. The Animation.py file uses them to create animations like those that are on this Github.

If you have questions about these, just ask me. :)
