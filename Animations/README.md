Every black dot in these animation represents a particle inside the box. Its position x is shown on the x-axis and its velocity v is shown on the y-axis. Particles move according to their velocity to the left and right and are shifted up and down by the collective electric field of all particles. The histogram on the y-axis is the velocity distribution, which corresponds to a projection of the phase space on the y-axis. Analogously, the histogram above shows the number density. 
In the extended animation, the violet plot in the upper left corner represents the electric field as a function of space. In the lower right corner, the energy is recorded. The blue curve is the kinetic energy, the yellow one the electric energy and the green one the total.


Yeah, I just realized that there is written $r=\infty$ in a bunch of animations. In the electron plasma wave animations, it is of course $r=0$ while in the default-two-stream it is $r=10$.
